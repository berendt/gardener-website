Gardener supports the backup and restore of etcd. It is the responsibility of the shoot owners to backup the workload data.
Gardener uses etcd-backup-restore component to backup the etcd backing the Shoot cluster regularly and restore in case of disaster. It is deployed as sidecar via etcd-druid. This doc mainly focuses on the backup and restore configuration used by Gardener when deploying these components.</description></item><item><title>Deploying the Gardener into a Kubernetes cluster</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.14.0/concepts/deployment/setup_gardener/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.14.0/concepts/deployment/setup_gardener/</guid><description>Deploying the Gardener into a Kubernetes cluster Similar to Kubernetes, Gardener consists out of control plane components (Gardener API server, Gardener controller manager, Gardener scheduler), and an agent component (Gardenlet). The control plane is deployed in the so-called garden cluster while the agent is installed into every seed cluster. Please note that it is possible to use the garden cluster as seed cluster by simply deploying the Gardenlet into it.</description></item><item><title>Deploying the previous Gardener versions and a Seed into an AKS cluster</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.14.0/concepts/deployment/aks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.14.0/concepts/deployment/aks/</guid><description>Deploying the previous Gardener versions and a Seed into an AKS cluster This document demonstrates how to install Gardener into an existing AKS cluster. We&amp;rsquo;ll use a single cluster to host both Gardener and a Seed to the same cluster for the sake of simplicity .
Please note that this document is to provide you an example installation and is not to be used in a production environment since there are some certificates hardcoded, non-HA and non-TLS-enabled etcd setup.</description></item><item><title>Feature Gates</title><link>https://gardener.cloud/v1.14.0/concepts/deployment/feature_gates/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://gardener.cloud/v1.14.0/concepts/deployment/feature_gates/</guid><description>Feature Gates in Gardener This page contains an overview of the various feature gates an administrator can specify on different Gardener components.
Overview Feature gates are a set of key=value pairs that describe Gardener features. You can turn these features on or off using the a component configuration file for a specific component.
Each Gardener component lets you enable or disable a set of feature gates that are relevant to that component.</description></item></channel></rss>
